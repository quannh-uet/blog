# Quan Nguyen blog for Develop

My blog with [Ghost CMS] (https://ghost.org/).

My theme is a fork of [Uno Zen](https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen)

##Installation
If you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible use install from zip:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.x**

2. Download the latest release tagged version or use <code>git clone</code>.

3. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and un-zip the package to that location.

4. Fire up a Terminal, the Node Command Prompt or shell and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)

5. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.

6. To start ghost, run `npm start`

7. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in
